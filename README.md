# Simple Blackjack Game

## Overview

- This is my attempt at a simple blackjack game played through the cli.

- It models the [standard rules of blackjack](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/) **except** for the following:
    1. There is only one player
    2. Player can not split pairs
    3. Player can not double down
    4. Dealer does not offer insurance
